# Mattermost plugin for Jenkins

Based on a fork of the Slack plugin:

https://github.com/jenkinsci/slack-plugin/

Which was a fork of the HipChat plugin:

https://github.com/jlewallen/jenkins-hipchat-plugin

Which was, in turn, a fork of the Campfire plugin.

Includes [Jenkins Pipeline](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin) support as of version 2.0:

```
mattermostSend color: 'good', message: 'Message from Jenkins Pipeline', text: 'optional for @here mentions and searchable text'
```
